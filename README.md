##  Projects

- [OSINT Military Base Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/AI-osint-base-analyzer) Designed and implemented a Python-based OSINT pipeline to analyze satellite imagery of military bases. Automated Google Earth navigation and screenshot capture using Selenium. Integrated vision-enabled LLMs (via Google AI Studio and OpenRouter) to assess images, generate JSON-based intelligence reports, and propose follow-up actions. A final "commander" model synthesized insights. Results were presented via a dynamic Streamlit GUI.

- [C2 Server](https://github.com/RonIsakov/C2_server)  a multi-threaded Command and Control (C2) system in Python, featuring a central server and remote client agent. The system operates over TCP using a custom, length-prefixed JSON protocol for reliable communication. Key capabilities include thread-safe management of concurrent clients, per-session logging, an interactive operator console for session switching, and robust security through configurable TLS encryption and token-based authentication.

- [Table Tennis Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/table-tennis-analyzer) Built a performance analysis system for table tennis using YOLO pose estimation, OpenCV, and EasyOCR. Tracked player positions, generated heatmaps, and extracted scoreboard data to visualize score progression. Included real-time frame filtering and CSV-based tracking for in-depth post-match review.
