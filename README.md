##  Projects

- [OSINT Military Base Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/AI-osint-base-analyzer) Designed and implemented a Python-based OSINT pipeline to analyze satellite imagery of military bases. Automated Google Earth navigation and screenshot capture using Selenium. Integrated vision-enabled LLMs (via Google AI Studio and OpenRouter) to assess images, generate JSON-based intelligence reports, and propose follow-up actions. A final "commander" model synthesized insights. Results were presented via a dynamic Streamlit GUI.

- [C2 Server](https://github.com/RonIsakov/C2_server) Simulation Developed a multi-threaded Command and Control (C2) server and client in Python based on a red-team exercise. Implemented a custom length-prefixed JSON protocol for TCP communication, supporting concurrent clients, thread-safe session management, per-session logging, TLS encryption, and token-based authentication.
