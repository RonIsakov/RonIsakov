# üëã Hi, I'm Ron Isakov

üéì I'm a Computer Science student at Reichman University, passionate about software development, IoT, AI, and solving complex problems at the intersection of technology and real-world impact.

## üíª Tech Stack & Skills

- **Languages:** Java, C, Python, JavaScript, Kotlin.
- **Knowledge in:** Git, Linux, SQL, HTML, CSS, IoT

## üöÄ Projects

- [OSINT Military Base Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/AI-osint-base-analyzer) Designed and implemented a Python-based OSINT pipeline to analyze satellite imagery of military bases. Automated Google Earth navigation and screenshot capture using Selenium. Integrated vision-enabled LLMs (via Google AI Studio and OpenRouter) to assess images, generate JSON-based intelligence reports, and propose follow-up actions. A final "commander" model synthesized insights. Results were presented via a dynamic Streamlit GUI.
