##  Projects

- [OSINT Military Base Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/AI-osint-base-analyzer) Designed and implemented a Python-based OSINT pipeline to analyze satellite imagery of military bases. Automated Google Earth navigation and screenshot capture using Selenium. Integrated vision-enabled LLMs (via Google AI Studio and OpenRouter) to assess images, generate JSON-based intelligence reports, and propose follow-up actions. A final "commander" model synthesized insights. Results were presented via a dynamic Streamlit GUI.

- [Medical Services AI Chatbot](https://github.com/RonIsakov/Part_2_Chat_Agent) Architected a bilingual (Hebrew/English) AI-driven chatbot for Israeli health services using a stateless microservices architecture. Leveraged Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) for intent recognition and ChromaDB for high-precision RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Implemented a robust two-phase conversation flow (Data Collection & Q&A) with FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend. Features include a dynamic 3-tier retrieval strategy, real-time Pydantic data validation, and full containerization via Docker.

- [Form 283 AI Extractor](https://github.com/RonIsakov/RonIsakov-OCR_extractor) Engineered an automated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline to digitize and structure complex government forms. Orchestrated Azure Document Intelligence for high-precision text extraction and GPT-4o for semantic parsing, converting mixed-language PDFs into strictly validated JSON. Built a robust Python backend using Pydantic for schema enforcement and data integrity, and deployed a Streamlit interface for real-time document processing and analytics.

- [C2 Server](https://github.com/RonIsakov/C2_server)  a multi-threaded Command and Control (C2) system in Python, featuring a central server and remote client agent. The system operates over TCP using a custom, length-prefixed JSON protocol for reliable communication. Key capabilities include thread-safe management of concurrent clients, per-session logging, an interactive operator console for session switching, and robust security through configurable TLS encryption and token-based authentication.

- [Table Tennis Analyzer](https://github.com/RonIsakov/table-tennis-analyzer) Built a performance analysis system for table tennis using YOLO pose estimation, OpenCV, and EasyOCR. Tracked player positions, generated heatmaps, and extracted scoreboard data to visualize score progression. Included real-time frame filtering and CSV-based tracking for in-depth post-match review.

- [Face Recognition Telegram Bot](https://github.com/RonIsakov/Telegram_Face_Recognition_Bot) Developed a Python-based Telegram bot for facial recognition tasks. Features include face registration, identification, celebrity look-alike search, and 2D similarity visualization. Utilized face recognition, real-time image processing, custom reply keyboards, and environment-based configuration.

- Cloud Computing & Distributed Systems [Course Project](https://github.com/RonIsakov/project_2_Cloud_Computing) – Achieved a perfect score (100/100). Architected a high-availability microservices system (Pet Store) using Python (Flask), Docker Compose, and MongoDB. Implemented Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle weighted round-robin load balancing and enforce header-based authentication.
[Course Project](https://github.com/RonIsakov/project_3_Cloud_Computing) Subsequently migrated the infrastructure to a cloud-native Kubernetes cluster (Kind), orchestrating Deployments, Services, and Persistent Volumes (PV/PVC) while securing API keys with K8s Secrets and automating deployment workflows via Shell scripting.

- Nand to TetrisCompleted the full "Nand2Tetris" course. Built a complete computer system from scratch, from logic gates to a working OS and compiler. Achieved a score of 100/100 on the final project.
